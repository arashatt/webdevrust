### SQL

ORM in sql means we can handle database operations in our interface in our programming language. These operations range from creating new entities, adding new records, various quering, indexing according to a field, sorting likewise, deleting, updating, and . . .
we should also be able to handle one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.

We start our discussion with Postgres, only after most of the requirements in the project is made clear, we can generalize over other databases.

create databse:

connect to database:
`\c`

```
ERROR:  template database "template1" has a collation version mismatch
```
